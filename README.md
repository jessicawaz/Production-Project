# Production Project
Production program that allows input from user for adding products and checking product lists. Utilizes java, css, sql, and databases. Allows for employee to sign up or sign in to start the process. User is then led to the Product Line tab where product information is entered. The produce tab has the user select an entered product and the quantity. The Production Log tab contains a log of all the products that were created and stored. 
This project was initially created during the fall semester for my Object-Oriented Programming class at Florida Gulf Coast University, but I had a fun time creating and designing all the tabs. It was created independently with some assistance from Professor Vanselow and the student assistants.
